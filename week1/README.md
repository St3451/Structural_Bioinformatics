2PTC is a PDB ﬁle containing trypsin (chain E) and its inhibitor (chain I). The active site of trypsin includes residues 57, 102 and 195.

Download the PDB ﬁle and visualize the enzyme/inhibitor complex, showing the active site and the inhibitor residues (within 4 Å) around it. Write a fully automated pymol script to make the ﬁgure. Pymol scripts have the extension .pml and can be executed using "File -> Run Script". Make the picture as visually appealing, striking and clear as you can using pymol's functionality Hand in a single PDF ﬁle with  
● the image  
● a caption (description) for the image  
● the pymol script
