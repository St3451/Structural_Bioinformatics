# Assignment 2 - PyMOL and PDB

* Pick (any) 3 consecutive letters from your first or last name and look up the corresponding PDB file.
* Briefly describe the structure (biology, ligands, experimental method etc.)
* Discuss structure quality.
* Discuss content of biological and asymmetrical unit. Are they the same? 
* Make two pictures of the content of the PDB file, with suitable captions.
* Submit as a PDF file.

## Execution

### Biology and structure

1STE is the PDB database ID of the SEC2 protein,  it is an enterotoxin type C-2 protein produced by Staphylococcus Aureus. It is a superantigen that activates the host immune system by binding to major histocompatibility (MHC) complex class II and T-Cell receptors. It is one of the causes of food poisoning. SEC2 is composed by a single polypeptide chain (type A) and its crystal structure reveal a zync-binding site (1.00 occupancy). The experimental method used is the X-ray diffraction.   
Structure quality
• The resolution is 2Å (acceptable)  
• R-factor is 25 (acceptable)  
• B-factor: there are no electron density maps for this structure, so the information about the B-factor is not available  
• Ramachandran plot: 1.7% outliers (bad)  
• Side chains: 3,9% outliers (bad)  

The resolution and R-factor of the 1STE file are acceptable but there are several outliers and the information about the B-factor is not available. So even if it has a decent resolution, since there may be several errors in the model I think that the overall quality is not so good.
 
### Biological and asymmetric unit

The biological and asymmetric unit are the same.  

### Two pictures of the PDB file with captions

The picture represent the overall structure of the SEC2 protein. Its type A chain is composed of alpha helix, beta sheets and other secondary structures. The grey sphere represent the zinc ion which has interactions with the yellow portion of the protein.

 This picture illustrate the five amino acids that interact with the zinc ion (black sphere). Hiss-122 (orange), Hiss-118 (yellow) and Asp-83 (green) bind to the ligand and the bonds are represented by grey dashed lines, while Lys-37 (light blue) and Thr-36 (dark blue) have an indirect interaction. The yellow dashed lines represent the hydrogen bonds between the amino acids that interact with the metal.
