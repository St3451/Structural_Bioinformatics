# Structural Bioinformatics

This repository contains some practical assignments and the final exam of Structural Bioinformatics course (second block of courses of my MSc in Bioinformatics). The course was divided in two parts: protein and RNA.

We performed some assignments using [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) but we mainly used python for the rest of the course. For the protein part we focussed on using [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) and [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) (especially [BIO.Pdb](https://biopython.org/wiki/The_Biopython_Structural_Bioinformatics_FAQ) module) packages.

The code used in assignment 5 and assigment 7 has been provided by our Structural Bioinformatics professor Thomas Hamelryck (Associate professor, Computational and RNA Biology; University of Copenhagen), which is also the main author/maintainer of the Bio.PDB module.
