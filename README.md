# Structural-Bioinformatics

This repository contains some of the practical assignments and the practical part of the final exam of this course (second block of MSc in Bioinformatics). The course was divided in two parts: protein part and RNA part.

We performed a couple of assignment using [PyMol](https://pymol.org/2/) but we mainly used python for the rest of the course. For the protein part we focussed on using [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) and [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) (especially [BIO.Pdb](https://biopython.org/wiki/The_Biopython_Structural_Bioinformatics_FAQ) module) packages.
