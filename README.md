# Structural-Bioinformatics

This repository contains some practical assignments and the final exam of this course (second block of MSc in Bioinformatics). The course was divided in two parts: protein part and RNA part.

We performed some assignments using [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) but we mainly used python for the rest of the course. For the protein part we focussed on using [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) and [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) (especially [BIO.Pdb](https://biopython.org/wiki/The_Biopython_Structural_Bioinformatics_FAQ) module) packages.

The code used in assignment 5 and assigment 7 has been provided by my Structural Bioinformatics professor Thomas Hamelryck (Associate professor, Computational and RNA Biology; University of Copenhagen), which is also the main author/maintainer of the Bio.PDB module.
